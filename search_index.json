Course Guide","keywords":"","body":"ETH Course Guide\nThis site is created for sharing course materials and learning experiences in ETH Zurich. All materials are contributed by the community.\nUnder every page there is a discussion system, where everyone is welcome to share experiences and feelings about individual courses. \nHopefully all these information can help ETH students in course selecting, learning and exam preparing.\nYou can browse courses by department in the leftside list, or find your course using the search bar.\nContribute Your Experiences!\nYou are welcome to contribute your own content to this website! This tutorial shows how to add courses or edit existing content easily using GitHub.\nLicense\nBy contributing to ETH Course Guide, you agree to share your contents under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank ZJU Course Guide Sharing Project and USTC Course Reviewing Forum for inspiring the creation of this site.\n"},"contributor_guide/":{"url":"contributor_guide/","title":"Contributor Guide","keywords":"","body":"Contributor Guide\nIf you would like to contribute your content, the simplest way is to use the GitHub website or desktop client. You will need a GitHub account to do so. (GitHub is the most popular platform for version control and project collaboration. It works upon the famous version control system git.)\nIn this guide, we demonstrate how to add a course page or edit a existing page using the GitHub website.\nUsing the GitHub Website\nEdit an existing page\nAt the top of every page in this site, there is a button called \"EDIT THIS PAGE\", as shown in the screenshot below. You may need to scroll up to see this top bar.\n\nClicking this button will lead you to the GitHub editor for this page. You may be asked to sign up and fork this repository before entering the editor. Markdown syntax is required for editing the file. After your editing is done, you will need to commit your changes. Please compose a description for your commit before committing, as exemplified below:\n\nAfter clicking \"Propose changes\", click \"Create pull request\" on the new page, so that the maintainers will be notified, and review and merge your changes into the website.\n\nCreate a page for a new course\nWhat if your course is not included in this website yet? Easy. Just create the file for that course from the repository page.\n\nClick \"Add file\"->\"Create new file\", enter the correct path and name following the directory structure described below, and everything next is just the same as the steps above.\n\nUpload files for a course\nTo upload files (e.g. your PDF cheatsheet) for a course, goto the corresponding folder in the GitHub repository, click \"Add file\"->\"Upload files\". Follow the instructions to upload your files, and add a link to the file in the course's README.md. You can find the link to the file by clicking your uploaded file, and copying the link address of the \"Raw\" button on that page.\nConclusion\nThe GitHub website only offers limited functionality for editing and uploading. Alternatively, if you are familiar with git commandlines, we do encourage you to  this repository from GitHub, make changes in your local repository, and send us pull requests!\nDirectory Structure\nWhen contributing, please do follow the directory structure of the repository. The courses are organised by department first, then by course name. Inside a course's folder, README.md includes the content shown at the course's webpage. All assets (images, pdfs, etc.) referenced by that webpage are either put in the same folder, or linked from outside the repository (e.g. your file sharing link).\nFor example, to contribute your content for a course, simply modify the Markdown (.md) file of that course, located in [department]/[course-name]/README.md.  If the course is not yet existent on this website, please create the Markdown file using the course's full name, put it in the directory of the professor's affiliated department, and link it by adding an entry in SUMMARY.md; for example, for Algorithms Lab in the Department of Computer Science, create a folder algorithms-lab in d-infk/, put your content in d-infk/algorithms-lab/README.md, then add
